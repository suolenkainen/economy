        ## Work orders are created by demand of a production place or a settlement population
        ## A production place always aims to have their resource storage filled and goods emptied
        ## If there isn't enough suppliers for a resource, the production place boosts up their buy market price
        ## If there is more than the capacity of resource storage being offered, production lowers market price
        ## If there is more demand than the supplier can produce, the sell price goes up
        ## If there isn't enough buyer for a good, the production place lowers their sell price
        ## All price modifications are calculated based on the surplus/lack of products -> Utilities
        ## The work orders are always attached to a settlement instead of the production place



        ## If there is a requirement in some settlement for some resource and there is room in storage, check if there is goods in near by settlement
        ## Order workers based on the closest settlement.
        ## If not the current settlement, travel to nearest settlement. If a workorder is larger than capacity of the worker, the workorder can be split into smaller pieces
        ## A workorder can be reserved for that worker
        ## Same worker can do two workorders from same starting place to same destination if there is capacity and enough workorders

        # def create_list_of_work_orders(): (Work order means the same thing as the goods file. Maybe change goods files to work orders
        #     pass
        #     return list_of_work_orders

        # for activeworker in worker_list:
        #     def search_for_nearest_requirement():
        #         pass
        #         return list of workers sorted by closeness to some requirement

        # for closest_worker_to_resource in worker_list:
        #     if list_of_work_orders is reserved, then redo calculation for that worker and sort to correct place
        #     remove payment amount from city and 
        #     end result is attaching all workers to work orders.



        ## Start moving workers to destinations based on their work order.
        ## The work order always costs to a settlement 10% of the selling fee and for purchase fee
        ## The goods are then attached to that settlement and distributed between production placed by percentage of need

        # def move_workers_towards_destination():
        #     pass
        #     check if arrived
        
        # def unload_goods_to_settlement():
        #     receive payment



        ## Resource goods are depleted from settlements by producers
        ## If a settlement has goods that are used by producers they are moved to that producers storage.
        ## If there is no room in production storage, no work orders are made for that good

        

        ## A settlement has needs based on the population. -> Utilities
        ## If a need is met, settlement can grow in population by some amount per turn
        ## If the needs are not met, the population decreases
        ## Based on the population, new production sites can appear to a settlement and production sites can increase and decrease
        ## If a production site decreases to 0, it is removed from settlement



        ## Future: Create paths the workers take to move between settlements. In crossroads, there might be a new settlement.
        ## Needs to have some mechanic to always go through the nearest settlement to reach the true destination
