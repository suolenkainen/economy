## Description of each worker
## It makes .wrk file to a folder "workers" and includes all relevant information
## These files are then read by the main loop and added to the simulation

Required attributes to be clarified.
- type of worker
- destination of work order (when not hauling, destination is the current settlement)
- speed of worker (when not hauling anything, speed is 0)
- distance of total journey
- progression of journey
- goods being handled
- carrying or production capacity
